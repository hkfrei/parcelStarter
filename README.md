# Parcel vanilla JS starter template

This is a starter template for a simple vanilla javascript app. It uses [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for module bundling.

## Getting Started

You can get a local copy of the project by running this command on your console:

```
git clone git@github.com:hkfrei/parcelVanillaJs.git
```

After that, you should have a new directory named "parcelVanillaJs". Enter it by typing...
`cd parcelVanillaJs`.

### Prerequisites

The project needs the package manager [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). You can install it from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installing

While in the newly created folder, install all the dependencies.

```zsh
yarn install
```

After that, you can start a development server by enter the following command...

```zsh
yarn dev
```

This command starts the bundling process and opens the development server on port 1234 => [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).

## Deployment

```zsh
yarn build
```

This disables watch mode and hot module replacement so it will only build once. It also enables the minifier for all output bundles to reduce file size. The minifiers used by Parcel are [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) for JavaScript, [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) for CSS, and [htmlnano](https://github.com/posthtml/htmlnano) for HTML.
After that, you can copy the contents of the `dist` folder to your webservers root directory.

## Linting

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/). You can start the linter by typing `yarn lint`. It it recommended to integrate the linter in the IDE of your choice. See [https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) for more info.
Altough it's not integrated in this project, we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in order to format the code. Prettier can be integrated in [various IDE's](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) and we recommend it very much.
